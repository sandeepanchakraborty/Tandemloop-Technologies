This repository contains solutions for screening questions, likely used for technical interviews or programming assessments. The codebase is primarily written in Java.

## Repository Structure

- `Calculator.class`  
  Compiled Java class file. The source code for this file is not present in the repository, but it is likely related to calculator functionality.

- `question1.java`  
  Java source file containing the solution for the first screening question.

- `question1.class`  
  Compiled Java class file for `question1.java`.

- `question2.java`  
  Java source file containing the solution for the second screening question.

- `question3.java`  
  Java source file containing the solution for the third screening question.

- `README.md`  
  This file. Provides an overview and instructions for the repository.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine (version 8 or above recommended).

### Compiling the Code

To compile the Java source files, use the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
javac question1.java
javac question2.java
javac question3.java
```

If you need to compile a source file for the Calculator (if available), use:

```sh
javac Calculator.java
```

### Running the Solutions

To run each solution, use:

```sh
java question1
java question2
java question3
```

Make sure you are in the directory containing the `.java` files.

## File Descriptions

- **question1.java**:  
  Solution for screening question 1.  
Problem-1: Create a small calculator which performs operations such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division using class.
  Calculator inputs :> ‘a’, ‘b’ and ‘type of operation’
  Datatype :> ‘a’ = double, ‘b’ = double, ‘type of operation’ = string

- **question2.java**:  
  Solution for screening question 2.  
Problem-2: With a single integer as the input, generate the following until a = x [series of numbers as shown in below examples]
 
  Output: (examples)
    1) input a = 1, then output : 1
    2) input a = 2, then output : 1, 3
    3) input a = 3, then output : 1, 3, 5
    4) input a = 4, then output : 1, 3, 5, 7
    .
    .
    5) input a = x, then output : 1, 3, 5, 7, .......
 

- **question3.java**:  
  Solution for screening question 3.  
Get the total count of number listed in the dictionary which is multiple of [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
  (examples)
  input: [1,2,8,9,12,46,76,82,15,20,30]
  Output: 
    {1: 11, 2: 8, 3: 4, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 1, 9: 1}

## Notes

- The repository was described as "question for screening 1", suggesting it is focused on practical coding assessments.
- If you wish to see the problem statements or more context, please refer to comments inside each `.java` file.
- No external dependencies are required; all solutions use standard Java libraries.
